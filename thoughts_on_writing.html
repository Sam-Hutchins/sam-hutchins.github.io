    <h1>Notes to myself on writing</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You're not writing for you:</strong> Writing should be done for the readers, and as many of them as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Remember what the point is:</strong> The point of writing is simply to get information from your head into someone elses head.  Your chosen medium is writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Using unnecessary complex words is just a burden on the reader. Do it for effect an never without thinking it through.</li>
        <li><strong>Edit Ruthlessly:</strong> Writing is editing, editing is cutting.</li>
    </ul>
